This is the v1.0 initial release of a dropbox API v2 upload app based on the updown.py script example included in the dropbox python sdk here:
github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-python/tree/master/example/updown.py
This app uploads the contents of a given folder to dropbox

v1.0 features:
1) updown.py has been battle hardened and extended to make it more suited for unattended scheduled operation
2) Supports NAS -> dropbox upload only
3) Has no ADM or web UI whatsoever
4) Implements an internal locking mechanism in /usr/local/AppCentral/community-dropbox-upload/lock to enable execution of multiple concurrent instances of the script for different rootdir source folders
5) Is slow on large dropbox accounts / data stores but is lightweight, will not thrash disks and can be depended on to eventually complete
6) The installer ensures all required python modules are present (pip install six, pip install lockfile, pip install dropbox)
7) The installer by default creates a single cron job containing a placeholder for the required dropbox oauth2 token. Multiple cron jobs can be created to execute the script on any required schedule(s)
8) Logs minimal output to the /usr/local/AppCentral/community-dropbox-upload/log folder
