### Why bother?
I couldn't get the [Asustor provided dropbox app](http://forum.asustor.com/viewforum.php?f=59) reliable and safely working. The full story is here: http://forum.asustor.com/viewtopic.php?f=59&t=8202

### What does this do?
At the present time this app only supports dropbox upload. Full 2 way sync may be supported in the future.

### How do I set this thing up?
This app can be easily installed via the ADM App Central manual install feature using one of the [pre-compiled apk package release files](/../../releases). There is no UI at the present time so once installed, some manual configuration is required. Read [the setup guide](setup.md) for details.
